The goal of this project is to create a algorithm that recommends a movie based on input that the user gives it. My plan is to use data from IMDB and use python to calculate the best movie to recommend to the user. This project will also allow the user to search up info on a movie and list the top movies by the category of their choice.

(P.S only movies and tv-shows from 1980 to 2024 are in this dataset that have > 50,000 votes on IMDB)
