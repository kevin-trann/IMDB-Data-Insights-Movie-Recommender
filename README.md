This project recommends the user titles based on the user's input. I used Python and Pandas to analyze this public dataset. Users can also search up info on a title and list top titles by the category of their choice.

(Only movies and tv shows from 1980 to 2024 and have > 50,000 votes are in this dataset due to upload limit issues)
